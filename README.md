# I followed a tutorial to get some of the base down and figure out p5js coding since I was using that editor and javascript for the first time: https://youtu.be/l0HoJHc-63Q 

# Overall I enjoyed making this project and I feel as though I learned a lot of useful skills throughout the process that I don't think I would have ever learned otherwise, and found a basic knowledge of python from this course very useful when using javascript. One big issue that I ran into was trying to make the counter only count once when the alien hit the orb, but it did not impact the overall gameplay so I decided to let it be after trying a bunch of things to fix it and honestly I feel as though it adds another level of randomness to the game in addition to the random appearanced of the fire and orbs that I don't hate. Also, the bulk of my code is in sketch.js.
