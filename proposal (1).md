# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Space Adventure 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Basically it's going to be a Mario platform game but like with an alien instead of mario and set in space. The main objectives will be that the character will have to move through the game to the finish while jumping and avoiding blocks and collecting something (not exactly sure what I want it to be that they're collecting, maybe like orbs or something) that they need to collect all of before  getting to the finish. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm using an online javascript editor, p5.js in order to do my coding. The software will have an opening screen, background music, and a title/victory screen at the end that will come up once the character reaches the end point. They will have to jump over and under blocks (they won't actually be blocks, but it will be something block-like) and collect something along the way in order to win (also unsure what that something it will be, as said in the last question). The program will use regular key controls like space bar to jump and right arrow to move like most video games require. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A platformer with basic forward and jumping movements while also collecting a secondary variable which will need to be collected in it's entirety to win. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as before, but with the addition of some kind of sound as collection is done and an active counter for the amount collected. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as before, but with the addition of a mini-boss at the end that the character can shoot beams or something at a few times in order to beat and get to the final checkpoint. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are looking at tutorials and other resources to get a better understanding of how javascript coding works and the specific commands that I need to know in order to get my code to work correctly. I also need to figure out how to import my images succesfully so that they stay consistent and correct throughout the runtime of the game. I feel like the hardest thing that I'm going to need to figure out is how to potentially code another character to act as a "boss" at the end, but figuring out how to make the character succesfully collect an object with sound will probably be pretty difficult as well. Overall, I need to form a decent understanding of javascript in order to do this project succesfully.
