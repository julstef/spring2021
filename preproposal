# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I'm in between two ideas now, the first is a twist on mario type game but with oncoming mobs that the "mario" character will fight, 
either with some type of beam/throw something or potentially directly interact with them, in order to get to the endpoint where they win. 
The second idea is a chrome extension which plays different music in the background of any webpage that would change automatically based on what
time of day it is, but this one would probably be more complicated since I wouldn't have a base to build off of like I do with the "mario" idea. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I do not plan to collaborate with anyone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
I'm a little unclear on if this final has to be primarily in python or can also be in other coding languages, because at least for my two ideas 
they would heavily include another coding language, especially the extension one.
