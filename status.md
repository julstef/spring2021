Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've solidly completed the base game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I'm part way through figuring out a way to make my character succesfully collect something, probably an orb of some kind. Also want to figure out how to make the background move with the character so that there's more cohesion and if I get that figured out well I might also add a collection counter.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had a hard time figuring out how to succesfully import the images that I am using and also how to make the jumping function work correctly.
